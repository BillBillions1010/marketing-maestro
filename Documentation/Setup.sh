# If you want to run the script on Ubuntu WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), make sure you have Ubuntu installed and set up on your Windows machine. Here's a revised version of the script specifically adjusted for running on Ubuntu WSL:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and install PostgreSQL
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y postgresql postgresql-contrib

# Start PostgreSQL service
sudo service postgresql start

# Access the PostgreSQL shell
sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_db;"

# Clone MedusaJS repository
git clone https://github.com/medusajs/medusa.git
cd medusa

# Install Node.js and npm
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs

# Install dependencies and configure PostgreSQL connection
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Update the .env file with your PostgreSQL connection details (localhost, port, username, password, database)

# Start the MedusaJS server in the background
npm run dev &

# Clone Next Material Kit repository
git clone https://github.com/creativetimofficial/nextjs-material-kit.git
cd nextjs-material-kit

# Install dependencies
npm install

echo "E-commerce web app setup completed. Happy selling!"
```

Adjustments Made for Ubuntu WSL:
1. Added `-y` flag in the PostgreSQL installation command to automate the installation process.
2. Started the PostgreSQL service explicitly.
3. Used a direct command to create the database in PostgreSQL without entering the shell interactively.
4. Installed Node.js and npm using a common method for Ubuntu.
5. Included comments for updating the `.env` file with PostgreSQL connection details.

After pasting the revised script into a file (e.g., `setup.sh`), you can run it in the Ubuntu WSL terminal to set up your e-commerce web app. Ensure that your Ubuntu WSL environment has necessary permissions and internet access for executing the commands. If you encounter any issues during the setup, feel free to ask for further assistance.
